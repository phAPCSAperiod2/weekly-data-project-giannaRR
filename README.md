AP CSA Project: Weekly Movie Tracker 📽️🍿

Theme: Movie Watching Habits

📌 Project Overview
The Movie Tracker is a Java-based data analyzer that tracks how many movies a user watches over a 7-day period. The program is designed to help movie buffs monitor their viewing habits and stay on track with their personal entertainment goals.

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including:

Encapsulation: Protecting data by using private instance variables.

Deep Copying: Avoiding reference aliasing by creating a unique copy of the data array.

Array Algorithms: Using loops to calculate totals, averages, and extreme values.

🎯 Features
Goal Setting: Allows users to input a target number of movies for the week.

Robust Input Validation: Prevents the entry of negative numbers using while loops.

Statistical Analysis: Automatically calculates:

Total movies watched.

Daily Average (formatted to two decimal places).

Highest & Lowest viewing days.

Interactive Insights: Provides feedback and a suggested goal for the following week based on the user's performance.

🧩 Technical Structure
The program is split into two distinct classes:

WeeklyData.java (Data Class): Handles the storage, deep copying, and mathematical logic.

App.java (Main Class): Handles user input, console interaction, and the display of the final report.

✅ Project Checklist Confirmation
[x] Used an array to store 7 days of data.

[x] Array is private and encapsulated within the class.

[x] All calculations (Total, Average, etc.) use loops rather than hard-coded math.

[x] Input is validated using a while loop to prevent invalid data.

[x] Deep copy is implemented in the constructor to avoid reference aliasing.

[x] Code is documented with JavaDoc comments.
